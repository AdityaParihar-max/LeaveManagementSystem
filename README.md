# LeaveManagementSystem
I have made an leave management system which is made using html, css , javascript for frontend and C# and PostgresSQL for backend.
This project contains two different sign in pages one for employee and the other for the admin, the employee can only apply for leaves and view all his leave history till day and the admin can also apply for leave but he can view leaves of all the employees by searching their email id and he can also approve and reject all leaves.
Employees can't access admin page but admin can access both admin and employee pages and we have to login to view the pages otherwise we will be redirected to the login page
